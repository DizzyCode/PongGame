# PongGame
*PongGame* is an experimental project based on the classical game *Pong*, made with Java and the [Slick2D Library](http://slick.ninjacave.com). This version implements some common features such as multi-level collision detection, and a somewhat functional AI. Before you download anything, keep in mind that the game is quite buggy and prone to occasional crashes. You have been warned!

This is my first (feeble) attempt at game development. Feel free to contribute and make suggestions; I am sure there is tremendous room for improvement.

### Objective
- Win a point by hitting the ball past the AI paddle
- Prevent ball from passing own paddle
- Win as many points as possible; the game continues indefinitely (or until a bug occurs)

### Controls
- **Up** arrow key to move paddle up
- **Down** arrow key to move paddle down

### Potential Improvements
- Clean up, eliminate bugs
- Set a max score to win the current round and start the next round
- Have ball pause one second between points
